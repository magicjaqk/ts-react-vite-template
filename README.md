### Svelte

Svelte is great for using with teams that are unfamiliar with the React ecosystem. The *Svelte*-specific ecosystem is smaller; however, the layer between svelte templating and raw javascript is far thinner. That makes it possible to use almost any javascript library with very little effort.

With Svelte, you'll often be paving your own way forward in Svelte-land since the community is smaller, but the paradigm is much more simple for non-React-brained folks to understand easily.

### SolidJS

It's been a few years since I tried out SolidJS. It's very similar to Svelte in that it uses [signals](https://docs.solidjs.com/concepts/signals) for reactivity. While Svelte uses a compiler to create signals and maintain a developer experience of mutable variables, SolidJS aims to recreate the developer experience of React.

SolidJS is an even smaller community than Svelte, but it's more mature, follows patterns of React's JSX, and has a highly dedicated community that makes up for its size.
